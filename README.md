### Profeshional 🧑‍💼

I am a software engineer.

I am not an expert in a single language or library.  Instead, I view the art of software engineering as an understanding of languages as a set of features, each designed to solve different problems, and picking the best tool for the job at hand.

### Personal 🥳

I enjoy using my technical skills to be creative.  Short list (TODO: expand this!): 3D rendering/modeling/printing, web development, networking, reverse engineering, drones and robotics.
